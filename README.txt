by fusion2004

This repo is the entire Netbeans project structure.

Based off of MultiThreadChatServer by Anatol Ursu <http://www.ase.md/~aursu/ClientServerThreads.html>.

Notes:
Current version requires client to send a "/quit" before disconnecting in order to prevent any errors.
Currently has a hard limit of 10 client connections.
